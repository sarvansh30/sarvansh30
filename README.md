<h1 align="left">Hey ðŸ‘‹ I'm Sarvansh</h1>

<p align="left">
I like figuring out how things work and then building things that make them work better. From playing with APIs and new frameworks to messing around with AI, I enjoy the process of learning by doing.

Most days, you'll find me experimenting with tech, shipping ideas, or deep-diving into something I didnâ€™t understand the day before. Iâ€™m all about staying curious, writing clean code, and building stuff that feels useful.

Always up for a new challenge, a good bug hunt, or a chat about how to make systems a little more elegant.
